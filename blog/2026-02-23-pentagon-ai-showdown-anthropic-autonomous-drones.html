        <div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none space-y-6 text-[color:var(--silver)] leading-relaxed">

          <p class="text-lg">This week, the defense technology world watched a collision between two forces that have been on an inevitable trajectory: the Pentagon&rsquo;s insatiable appetite for AI-driven autonomy and the guardrails that AI companies have built around their most powerful models. Meanwhile, a $100M drone swarm competition drew SpaceX into the autonomous warfare arena, and the DoD signaled $66 billion in IT spending for FY2026. Here&rsquo;s what it all means.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[color:var(--white)] mt-10">The Anthropic-Pentagon Standoff</h2>
          <p>The biggest defense tech story of the week isn&rsquo;t about hardware&mdash;it&rsquo;s about terms of service. The Pentagon threatened to classify Anthropic as a &ldquo;supply chain risk&rdquo; after the AI company pushed back on unrestricted military use of its models, specifically around domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons without human oversight.</p>
          <p>The facts are striking: Anthropic is currently the <strong>only AI company</strong> with models deployed on classified DoD networks, operating under contracts worth up to $200 million. Yet negotiations over &ldquo;going forward&rdquo; terms have stalled because the company insists on maintaining safety boundaries that the Pentagon views as operational constraints.</p>
          <p>A meeting between Anthropic&rsquo;s CEO and the Defense Secretary is scheduled for this week. The Pentagon&rsquo;s CTO has publicly argued it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not democratic&rdquo; for a private company to limit how the military uses AI. The subtext is clear: the DoD wants unrestricted access, and it&rsquo;s willing to use its purchasing power as leverage.</p>
          <p>This matters beyond the boardroom. Last summer, the Pentagon awarded Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI contracts worth up to $200 million each to customize generative AI for military applications. A new executive order requires defense officials to incorporate specific AI usage language into all DoD contracts within 180 days. The rules of engagement between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon are being written right now.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[color:var(--white)] mt-10">The $100M Orchestrator Competition</h2>
          <p>While the AI ethics debate dominated headlines, a more concrete development was unfolding: the Pentagon launched its &ldquo;Orchestrator&rdquo; competition, a $100 million effort to develop autonomous drone swarm coordination technology. SpaceX and xAI are among the competitors.</p>
          <p>The competition is run jointly by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Defense Autonomous Warfare Group (DAWG)&mdash;a new entity under SOCOM created by the current administration. DAWG inherits and extends the Biden-era Replicator initiative, which aimed to field thousands of expendable autonomous drones but was criticized for failing to deliver at scale.</p>
          <p>The shift from Replicator to DAWG/Orchestrator is significant. Replicator focused on <em>production volume</em>&mdash;getting more drones built. Orchestrator focuses on <em>coordination</em>&mdash;getting swarms to operate autonomously. As one Pentagon official put it: &ldquo;the factory is the weapon.&rdquo; The bottleneck isn&rsquo;t building drones; it&rsquo;s making them fight together.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[color:var(--white)] mt-10">$66 Billion in Defense IT and the Edge AI Surge</h2>
          <p>The DoD requested $66 billion in IT spending for FY2026&mdash;a $1.8 billion increase over last year&mdash;with artificial intelligence at the top of the priority list. That number alone tells a story, but the composition is more revealing.</p>
          <p>Edge AI is emerging as a distinct spending category. Government contracts are accelerating for autonomous security systems that process intelligence at the point of collection rather than streaming data back to cloud infrastructure. This is a structural shift: the Pentagon is moving from centralized AI (big models in data centers) to distributed AI (small models on devices in the field).</p>
          <p>The military UAV sector alone is forecast to surpass $40 billion as modern warfare evolves around autonomous platforms. This isn&rsquo;t speculative venture capital math&mdash;it&rsquo;s procurement budget math, backed by appropriations and contracts.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[color:var(--white)] mt-10">Air Force CCA Software and the Autonomy Stack</h2>
          <p>The Air Force announced partnerships to build the software stack for Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs)&mdash;the autonomous wingmen that will fly alongside manned fighters. Flight testing for the DARPA LongShot program could begin as early as late 2026.</p>
          <p>CCAs represent the high end of military autonomy, but the architecture pattern is universal: edge-deployed sensing, local decision-making, mesh networking, and human-on-the-loop (not in-the-loop) control. The same autonomy stack that coordinates drone swarms will eventually coordinate ground sensors, unmanned vehicles, and ISR platforms.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[color:var(--white)] mt-10">The Drone Dominance &ldquo;Gauntlet&rdquo;</h2>
          <p>Separately, the Pentagon&rsquo;s Drone Dominance initiative is running production &ldquo;gauntlets&rdquo;&mdash;competitions designed to stress-test manufacturing scalability. The emphasis isn&rsquo;t on who builds the best drone; it&rsquo;s on who can build thousands of good-enough drones fast enough to matter.</p>
          <p>This mirrors a broader lesson from Ukraine: in attritional autonomous warfare, production rate trumps unit performance. The defense industrial base is being reshaped around rapid, scalable manufacturing of autonomous systems&mdash;a fundamental departure from the exquisite, low-volume platforms that dominated the last two decades.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[color:var(--white)] mt-10">Ceradon&rsquo;s Take</h2>
          <p>Three threads from this week converge on a single insight: <strong>the future of defense technology is edge-deployed, autonomous, and sensor-driven.</strong></p>
          <p>The Anthropic standoff reveals that the Pentagon wants AI systems it can deploy without restrictions at the tactical edge&mdash;not locked behind safety APIs in a data center. The Orchestrator competition shows that autonomous coordination (not just individual autonomy) is the critical gap. And the $66B IT budget confirms that this isn&rsquo;t aspirational&mdash;it&rsquo;s funded.</p>
          <p>This is precisely the environment passive WiFi sensing was built for:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-3 ml-4">
            <li><strong class="text-[color:var(--white)]">Edge-native by design.</strong> Passive sensing runs on COTS hardware at the point of collection. No cloud dependency, no data exfiltration risk, no bandwidth bottleneck. When the Pentagon says it wants edge AI, this is what edge AI looks like in the ISR domain.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-[color:var(--white)]">Autonomy-ready.</strong> Through-wall presence detection feeds directly into autonomous decision loops. A drone swarm coordinated by an Orchestrator still needs to know what&rsquo;s on the other side of a wall before breaching. Passive sensors provide that intelligence without revealing the operation.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-[color:var(--white)]">Scalable economics.</strong> At $5,000&ndash;$10,000 per unit versus $60,000&ndash;$85,000 for active radar alternatives, passive sensing fits the Drone Dominance production philosophy&mdash;field many affordable sensors, not a few exquisite ones.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-[color:var(--white)]">No AI ethics friction.</strong> Passive sensing is a sensor, not a decision-maker. It detects presence; humans (or human-supervised systems) decide what to do about it. There&rsquo;s no Anthropic-style standoff over autonomous targeting because the system doesn&rsquo;t target anything&mdash;it reports.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The defense technology landscape is splitting into two tracks: high-end AI platforms that come with ethical and contractual complexity, and edge-deployed sensing systems that provide raw intelligence without those constraints. The companies that win in the next decade will be the ones building the sensor layer that autonomous systems depend on&mdash;not the ones arguing about terms of service.</p>
